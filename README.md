# 🧪 GenAI Experiments & Testbed

This repository is a personal sandbox of experiments and tests using Generative AI tools, libraries, and frameworks such as **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **OpenAI APIs**, **Vector DBs**, and more.

It includes:
- Basic and advanced use cases of LangChain (agents, chains, memory, tools)
- LlamaIndex integrations with document loaders, query engines, and storage
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines
- Prompt engineering tests
- Multi-modal capabilities (text-to-image, audio, etc.)
- Notes, debug logs, and performance observations

💡 Perfect for exploring, debugging, and prototyping LLM features in one central place.
